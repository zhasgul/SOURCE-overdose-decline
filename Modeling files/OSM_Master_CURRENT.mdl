Policy levers are operationalized as % changes to the relevant parameter or input time series. All levers have the same absolute directionality, i.e. positive values increase the parameter or time series while negative values decrease it. For variables with a 0-1 probability range, a policy change of -1 means 0% probability and a policy change of 1 means 100% probability. Levers can be adjusted in combination with different magnitudes and directions, as appropriate, to test policies with multiple effects or to test multiple simultaneous policies. All policy levers take effect at the same time, specified using the Policy Activation Time slider (default 2020). The default is a 1-year ramp for implementation.

211223 - Modified formulation of misuse vars with NSDUH redefinition effect to remove hardcoded '2019' values and replace with MaxDataTime instead.
12,8,0,271,872,171,45,8,7,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
211228 - Added switches for testing alternative H price / availability input formulation and single Rx availability construct; adjusted read-in for data variables to accommodate partial data in most recent year
12,9,0,275,992,197,56,8,135,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220106 - Updated Rx demand quantities. Split remission priors to read constants into time-dependent prior variables. Added monthly bup TPT data and control switch. Linked projection start time to MaxDataTime. Switched default Rx vs H availability to single construct.
12,10,0,269,1124,216,56,8,135,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220112 - Corrected error in ODTo and ODHC read to calibration. Corrected PriorErr to account for TIME STEP so that priors contribute appropriately to payoff. Converted NFOD ratio priors to annual only to prevent over-weighting accordingly. Switched default end year to 2020.
12,11,0,793,128,184,45,8,7,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220113 - Updated Opioid Prescribing & Supply sector to incorporate new monthly TPT data & derivations therefrom, including duration of use and duration of prescriptions. Modified calculations of Rx supply and input projections accordingly.
12,12,0,793,244,127,36,8,7,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220118 - Updated Bup Tx capacity parameters with new values from partial model calibration to reflect monthly Bup TPT data
12,13,0,780,340,132,23,8,135,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220127 - Added switch for additional fent OD sensitivity testing
12,14,0,788,432,111,36,8,7,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
220214 - Corrected erroneous hardcoding (which assigned nonzero values to some policy change variables)
